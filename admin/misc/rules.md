**2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations**<br />
Zoom for meetings and Slack and text message for general communication. Each member should be avid on Slack in order to get updates as soon as possible. More important information will also be sent via text message in the SMS group. Zoom links will be available on the group Slack. The group’s Github repository should be the single-source of truth, and a list of issues/bugs will be posted on the Github repository, so if any issues arise from the code (yours or others), post in on that file in the repository and notice the person working on the file with the bug. If you can suggest a solution, please do so. We will also hold votes with Google Forms.<br />

**3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)**<br/>
Each meeting for around 2 hours<br/>
- 2:30 PM on Mondays
- 6:00 PM on Thursdays<br/>

**4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members**<br/>
- Be reachable and available (at least via the agreed communication choice).
- Be respectful, be patient, and be mindful of others. 
- Git pull often, and make sure your code works and does not break anything before pushing onto the dev branch
- If you cannot meet a deadline or a scheduled meeting, then at least 48 hours prior to the time, you should notify the team (earlier is better of course). 

**5) Conflict Resolution**<br/>
For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to reach out and offer help if needed or pivot work to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor. General disagreements on features or implementation will be handled by majority vote.<br/>

**6) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s**<br/>
```If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.```<br/>
