## Front End Documentation

This documentation is generated using JSDocs from `.js` files in `source/frontend` directory of the [main project repository](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group29/cse110-sp21-group29) using the workflow at `.github/workflows/frontend.yml` and stored in `docs/frontend` of the main repo.

The workflow runs every time a chage is pushed onto the `frontend` branch of the main repo.

It is hosted in Github Pages using [this public repo](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group29/docs).

The workflow handles transferring the front end documentation at `docs/frontend` of the main repo to the public repo, but note that it might take a few minutes for changes to update, and a hard reload might be required.
