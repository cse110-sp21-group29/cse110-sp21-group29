## Front End Documentation

This documentation is generated using JSDocs from `.js` files in `source/frontend` directory of the main project repo using the workflow at `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`.

This automated process will handle all front end documentation.

It is hosted in Github Pages using [this public repo](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group29/docs).
