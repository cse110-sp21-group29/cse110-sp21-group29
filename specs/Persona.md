## About Me
I am an undergraduate student majoring in Business. I currently have two jobs: as a waiter in a resturant and as a tutor. Although I stay on top of my academics and work, it is stressful and difficult to rememeber all I need to get done at times. I love sticking to schedules and knowing what I need to get done.   

## Needs 
<li> Able to keep track of when I have work and tutoring on a weekly basis 
<li> Have remainders of when my assignments are due and when I have upcoming exams 
<li> Able to schedule when I have free time and when I need to study 
<li> Sometimes I need to vent and would like to be able to just write how my day was or random thoughts 

## Concerns 
<li> Too many features can make it confusing to use 
<li> Won't be able to set reminders as urgent or important (entries are non-distinguishable)
<li> Not being able to see prvious entries
