* Status: Approved
* Deciders: All members of group 29
* Date: 2021-05-25
  
## Context and Problem Statement
Web applications tend to be built as single-page application, websites as multi-page, although it is
possible for a web app to be multi-page. 

## Considered Options
* Single-Page Application
* Multi-Page Application 

## Decision Outcome
The decision was approved and the frontend team worked on creating a single-page application
Ultimately we decided to do this by creating web components and using hashlinks and CSS to change which
web component was used.

## Pros and Cons

### Single-Page
* Single-page is considered the standard way to make a web app
* Back and forward buttons work
* One of the bad things is it required more work, and created formatting issues that had to be resolved

### Multi-Page
* Presumably "easier" but not really known
