## About

I am a first year Masters student at NYU (New York University). I am used to the college life as I have finished my undergraduate. I am stress on the daily basis, more than undergrad as I have taken on more responsibilies. I am originally from Tempe, Arizona and I bounce back and forth from school to home every semester. With such a busy life keeping track of what I have to do now versus later is very important to me, as well as obligations I have to make due to prior commitment. 

## Technology Literacy

I am familiar with Apple gadgets and I do have an iPhone. However, when is comes to school I do all my work on Window based computers. I have used tech from a young age and am pretty quick to grasp new tech. I am not one to read manuals or tutorials and opted to learn as I go. My major has introduced me to basic coding with Python, besides that I am unfamiliar with programming.
