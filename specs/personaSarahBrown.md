## About Me
I am a freshman UC Davis student who hasn't decided her major yet! I don't know what I want to major in, so I'm trying to take a wide range of classes and participate in lots of clubs and extracurriculars to give me a sense of what I want to do. College has been pretty overwhelming for me because my high school was so small, so honestly having something that I can refer to so that I can manage my time and try all the things I want to, as well as reduce my anxiety with just having that schedule easily accessible and readily available, would be great. 

## Needs 
<li> Able to keep track of club/extracurricular meetings and potentially a place I could write my thoughts and notes about whether or not I like participating in it or not
<li> Able to remind me of when my assignments are due and when I have upcoming exams 
<li> Able to journal or room to brainstorm future ideas of what I want to do 
<li> Able to store contact information, locations, or general notes of my new location because I'm not familiar with Davis yet, so having restaurants or different areas written down can help me feel more confident getting to know the area 

## Concerns 
<li> Getting cluttered with the variety of things I would do (no tagging system or way to search past entries) 
<li> Difficult to learn how to use, especially since I do not have time to learn a new app right now

## Technology Literacy
I have a lot of Apple gadgets, but have never used a PC before, so anything that is easily used on Apple products would be easy for me to pick up.
