## About
I am a college freshman in UCSD. I am kind of struggling with the fast-paced university life. The pandemic makes my university life even worse. I am a person who is easy to be distracted. Staying at home and taking courses, I am always tempted by the colorful world cell phones provide and I am always attracted by the interesting world games provide. I can play cell phone and games all day and totally forget about school work. Because of that and also because I am a dilatory person, I always leave tons of homework untill the day it is due and sometimes I even forget about homework. I am struggling with the situation I am in. I hope there is some apps can help me get out of the mire I am in.  

## Technology Literacy

I have been gaming from a young age and am familiar with downloading mods like for games like minecraft. I am familiar with both Apple and Window products and have no problem switching between the two, however, I typically use Window products. I am adept at downloading apps and can easily identitfy things that are scams online as I have grown up in a tech world!

College has been pretty overwhelming so I don't have a ton of time.

## About
I am a freshman UC Davis student who hasn't decided her major yet! I don't know what I want to major in, so I'm trying to take a wide range of classes and participate in lots of clubs and extracurriculars to give me a sense of what I want to do. College has been pretty overwhelming for me because my high school was so small, so honestly having something that I can refer to so that I can manage my time and try all the things I want to, as well as reduce my anxiety with just having that schedule easily accessible and readily available, would be great. 

## Technology Literacy
I have a lot of Apple gadgets, but have never used a PC before, so anything that is easily used on Apple products would be easy for me to pick up.

## About

I am a first year Masters student at NYU (New York University). I am used to the college life as I have finished my undergraduate. I am stress on the daily basis, more than undergrad as I have taken on more responsibilies. I am originally from Tempe, Arizona and I bounce back and forth from school to home every semester. With such a busy life keeping track of what I have to do now versus later is very important to me, as well as obligations I have to make due to prior commitment. 

## Technology Literacy

I am familiar with Apple gadgets and I do have an iPhone. However, when is comes to school I do all my work on Window based computers. I have used tech from a young age and am pretty quick to grasp new tech. I am not one to read manuals or tutorials and opted to learn as I go. My major has introduced me to basic coding with Python, besides that I am unfamiliar with programming.
